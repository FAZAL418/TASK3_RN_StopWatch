# React Native Stopwatch

A simple stopwatch app built with React Native. The app allows users to start, pause, and reset the stopwatch, and it also persists the last recorded time using AsyncStorage.

## Features

- **Start and Pause Stopwatch**: Begin or pause the stopwatch to record time.
- **Reset Stopwatch**: Reset the stopwatch to zero.
- **Persist Last Time**: The app uses AsyncStorage to save and load the last recorded time.
